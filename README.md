>idk how to format this file but who cares
Gonna add random math formulas til i get tired
Currently solving:

1. Dichotomy method 
2. Lagrange polynomial

To be done:

1. It can't be all in a single file so i need to think how to improve that, idk maybe should make different libraries for each category of formula, 
ie. geometry, algebra, calculus
2. GUI improvements, but also too lazy to do that cuz it doesnt rlly matter so
3. idk tutorials on how to use each formula? nah too much effort
4. Focus on practical use maybe cuz then there would be a reason to even open it?
