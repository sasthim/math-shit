# math-shit
Gonna add random math formulas til i get tired

Currently solving:

1.Dichotomy method 
2.Lagrange polynomial


To be done:

1.It can't be all in a single file so i need to think how to improve that, idk maybe should make different libraries for each category of formula, 
ie. geometry, algebra, calculus
2. idk
